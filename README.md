2. Ensure that you have the necessary packages installed. These can be found in the requirements.txt file. To install them, use the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Unzip the Image_classification_data.zip file to access the original data used for this project.

4. Navigate to the jupyter_notebook directory and open the notebook.ipynb file. This Jupyter notebook contains all the code and detailed analysis for this project.

5. If you want to test the models, you can find the trained models in the jupyter_notebook/models directory.

6. You can find the evaluation report for the data in independent_evaluation/srep45938.pdf.

7. output_data contains the processed data used for the project. This includes a CSV file of combined data and evaluation reports.

8. For details on the project requirements and grading rubric, refer to the requirement_rubric directory.
